I have academic training in data science, mathematics, social science, and philosophy. I am currently a part-time graduate student in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Northwest Missouri State University and hold a M.Sc. in Data Science from Eastern University, with a capstone/thesis on the philosophy and application of the Akaike Information Criterion for statistical inference. I graduated Phi Kappa Phi in the Liberal Arts and Sciences at Northern Illinois University <i>summa cum laude</i>.
