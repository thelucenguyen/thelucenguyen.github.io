  <h2 id="about-heading">About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a data scientist specializing in fraud prevention, financial analytics, and statistical modeling, with experience across diverse industries. Currently, I work in the Predictive Modeling group at <strong>LegalMatch</strong>, where I focus on AI/ML engineering, statistical forecasting, and algorithmic matching to transform the legal services industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, I serve as a consultant with <strong>Chromatic Data</strong>, a strategic artificial intelligence consultancy dedicated to leveraging synthetic data for social impact organizations. My consulting spans data science, artificial intelligence, and computational social science.

  <p>
    My academic background bridges data science, mathematics, social science, and philosophy. I am currently pursuing graduate studies in <strong>Artificial Intelligence Management</strong> at Georgetown University, where I explore the intersection of technology, leadership, and AI strategy.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hold an <strong>M.Sc. in Data Science</strong> from Eastern University, where my thesis examined the philosophy and application of the Akaike Information Criterion for statistical inference. I earned my undergraduate degree <em>summa cum laude</em> in Liberal Arts and Sciences from Northern Illinois University, graduating <strong>Phi Kappa Phi</strong> with concentrations in quantitative social science and philosophy of science. I have also completed graduate-level coursework in mathematics at Northwest Missouri State University.

  <p>
    I am certified as a <strong>Climate Protection Professional</strong>, and outside of my technical work, I enjoy pursuing creative and personal passions. I am a published poet, a former professional photographer, and an enthusiastic amateur baker and chef. When I’m not working or creating, you’ll most likely find me outdoors.

<b>Personal Note and Reflections</b>
 <P>
On a personal note, much of my life's work has been inspired by Dr. Kenneth P. Burnham, Emeritus Professor of the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology at Colorado State University and retired Senior Scientist with the United States Geological Survey. In addition to writing <i>Model Selection and Multimodel Inference: An Information-Theoretic Approach</i> (available <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b97636">here</a> from Springer Nature) with the late theoretical ecologist Dr. David R. Anderson that inspired my master's research "Inference Using the Akaike Information Criterion", a personal note he once sent me has been part of my guiding career principles:
<P>
<blockquote><p>"Too much of statistics, and statisticians, are driven by pure mathematics at the expense of useful applied statistics and data science."</p></blockquote>
<P>
At the age of 11, I happened across the late mathematician-logician Haskell B. Curry's text trying to resurrect the formalist school of the philosophy of mathematics after the consequences of Gödel's incompleteness theorems were understood, <i>Outlines of a Formalist Philosophy of Mathematics</i>. A student of David Hilbert, he was surely inspired by Hilbert's famous words: "Wir müssen wissen. Wir werden wissen." [English translation: "We must know. We will know. "] I have re-read Curry's philosophical opus every year for over a decade now to better understand, to use Curry's terminology, the science of formal systems (or formal methods) that is mathematics. The greatest romance I have ever known is the reason of theorems and axioms that is mankind's attempt to organize the structure of reality with the language of mathematics.
<P>
Pure mathematics has long been a driving force in my life. I was first admitted to college at the age of 13 based upon my love of differential equations and the combinatory calculus. Yet life has always proved more complex than the rigid formalisms of logical operations might allow: turbulent flows and complex systems define the world we have inherited for ourselves. Though David Hilbert and his protege Haskell Curry might believe that we must and will know, sometimes we must accept good enough inferences to the best explanation without true knowledge. Sometimes the "useful applied statistics and data science" helps us get asymptotically ever-closer to the ideal of realizing the nature of Curry's "essence of mathematics... not in any particular kind of formal system, but in formal structure as such."
<P>
If my life has been defined by any one thing, it has been chasing after the shadows of formal structure projected on the walls of Plato's cave. Whether those lights that project those shadows have been epistemology, social science, or scikit-learn, I have always sought to appreciate the trace of this world beyond our own. I have found Dr. Anderson's information-theoretic language and his call for practical applications particularly useful tools in this regard. I can say in no small part that my academic and professional careers have been driven by this ambition.
