I am a data scientist with experience in fraud prevention, financial analytics, and statistical modeling in a wide range of industrial applications. I currently work in the Predictive Modeling group at LegalMatch, where I work on AI engineering, statistical forecasting, and algorithmic matching for the legal services industry. I also consult on data science, artificial intelligence, and computational social science issues at Chromatic Data, a strategic artificial intelligence consultancy focused on synthetic data for social impact organizations.
<P>
I have academic training in data science, mathematics, social science, and philosophy. I am part of the first cohort of the program in Artificial Intelligence Management at Georgetown University, focusing on the ethics and risks of the applications of machine learning/artificial  intelligence in industry, especially for safety-critical systems and cybersecurity. I hold a M.Sc. in Data Science from Eastern University, with a capstone/thesis on the philosophy and application of the Akaike Information Criterion for statistical inference. I graduated Phi Kappa Phi in the Liberal Arts and Sciences at Northern Illinois University <i>summa cum laude</i> focusing on quantitative social science and the philosophy of science. I also did graduate coursework in mathematics at Northwest Missouri State University.
<P>
In my free time, I am an actuarial candidate and am working through examinations for the field. I also hold a certification as a Climate Protection Professional, am a published poet, was formerly a professional photographer, am an amateur baker and chef, and am an avid enjoyer of the outdoors.
